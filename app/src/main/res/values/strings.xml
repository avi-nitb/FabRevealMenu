    <string name="dummy">Similar to the P1 sheet above, we create an mBottomSheetBehavior2 and assign it the same way. To achieve the effect where the sheet slides partially out of the screen, we set the BottomSheetBehavior’s peekHeight. In the sample app, we set the peek height using mBottomSheetBehavior2.setPeekHeight(300);  When the peekHeight is set, the bottom sheet collapses to the defined peekHeight in pixels. Take note of that. The sheet would expand to it’s target height, but on collapse, it collapses to the target height and remains on screen. To collapse the bottom sheet completely out of the screen, we would either need to set the peekHeight to 0 and then reset the state or, we could set the BottomSheetBehavior state to STATE_HIDDEN. For our demo app, we have elected to set the state to STATE_HIDDEN. Before setting the bottom sheet to that state, we must first set the behavior to be hideable using the setHideable(true) method</string>
